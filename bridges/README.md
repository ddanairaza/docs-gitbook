## New Horizons for Interoperability
The Beam Bridge is a two-way bridge between Beam and Ethereum blockchains that enables cross-chain cryptocurrency transfers.

Beam Bridge connects Beam’s private DeFi (PriFi) to Ethereum’s vast DeFi and Token ecosystems. Currently, supported assets include ETH, DAI, WBTC, and USDT. When bridging assets over from Ethereum, tokens are locked with an Ethereum Smart contract and minted on the Beam blockchain as wrapped Confidential Assets (CAs).

## Get Started with Beam Bridge

To bridge assets between Beam and Ethereum blockchain (and vice versa), users will need the following:

* [**MetaMask wallet**](https://metamask.io/) 
* [**Beam Wallet**](https://beam.mw/downloads/dappnet-mac)

MetaMask is required for storing, and transferring crypto assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
Beam Wallet is required to store, and transferring crypto assets on the Beam blockchain.
