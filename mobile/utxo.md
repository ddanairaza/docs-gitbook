  Since cryptocurrency is, by definition, digital, UTXO's function the same way
  dollar bills do with fiat currency. If your physical wallet carries banknotes,
  then your digital wallet carries UTXOs.

# UTXO



{% hint style="info" %}
**What is a UTXO, and how does it apply to your Beam coins?**

1. **UXTO (unspent transaction value)**.\
   UTXO represents the amount of cryptocurrency remaining after each transaction. The "output" for each UXTO creates a new "input" for new transactions.
2.  **Your Beam wallet automatically selects the UTXO for each transaction**.

    Your Beam wallet automatically minimizes the output value you receive by automatically selecting the UTXO for each transaction.&#x20;

    You will not be able to send or spend your UTXOs until each transaction is complete.                                                                           &#x20;
