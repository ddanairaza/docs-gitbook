# Address Book

## Address book

The address book tab is where you will find:

* **My Active Addresses**: active wallet addresses secure and ready to send or receive Beam coins.&#x20;
* **My Expired Addresses**: expired wallet addresses from previous transactions.
* **Contacts Lists**: a helpful list of previously sent wallet addresses.&#x20;

## How it looks in your wallet

### 'My Active' addresses

{% hint style="info" %}
**Remember**: the wallet address data listed in transactions or address book does not reflect the address data stored on the blockchain.
{% endhint %}

### 'My Expired' addresses

Addresses expire after every sent transaction and become inactive. Conversely, you can receive payments with the same address a total of 10 times. Mobile Wallet addresses have a default expiration date of 24 hours

Always double-check that you are not using an expired address to receive or send your Beam coins.
