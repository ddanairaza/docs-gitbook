{% hint style="info" %}
**Did you know you can create a new Confidential Asset in the Command Line?**&#x20;

See our Beam Wallet Command Line [User Guide](https://beamx.gitbook.io/cli-guide/-Ma54aPfLzmz7w0FPI32/) for more information. Also, see our asset creation [helper](https://explorer.beam.mw/asset-create) that conveniently generates the string to complete your new confidential asset!
