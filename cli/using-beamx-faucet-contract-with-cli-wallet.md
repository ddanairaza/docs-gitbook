# Using Beam smart contracts with CLI Wallet

## Getting Started

Beam compatible binaries are available for [all platforms](https://beam.mw/downloads/mainnet-mac) on our main website.&#x20;

Advanced users that wish to build Beam directly from our source code can see this [guide](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/How-to-build) for a more detailed run down. &#x20;

We strongly recommend for all users, casual and hardcore, that you download the node, CLI wallet in addition to the Desktop wallet. The application for smart contracts is in its infancy, with many unique and helpful smart contracts lacking a graphical interface, meaning they are only available through the Command-Line.&#x20;

Building out your node and operating the CLI wallet will keep you at the forefront of all the latest and coolest features that Beam has to offer. It is a simple process that only takes a minute.

## Getting the Shaders

Beam Smart Contracts deploy via an application called **Beam Shaders**. Beam Shaders are small (or not so small) programs compatible with several different programming languages before being compiled as a `.wasm` file since Beam Virtual Machine (BVM) runs on WebAssembly.

No coding experience is necessary; several Beam Shader applications are ready and available to [download](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/tree/mainnet/bvm/Shaders).&#x20;

Select from the list of Beam Shader apps and get into some 'shady business!'

![](<.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-10-26 at 12.43.27 PM.png>)

As seen from the above example, there are several app folders, i.e., '`Faucet`,' '`Dao-core`,' and inside each folder will be a list of files that will resemble the following:

![](<.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-10-26 at 12.39.50 PM.png>)

The reason for that is that each application comes in two parts. The first is the contract deployed to the blockchain (`contract.wasm`) and the second allows the wallet to interact with the contract (`app.wasm`). We suggest creating a `shaders` folder inside the `beam` folder with the subfolder with specific apps like `faucet`.

Now let's see how we can run some apps!

* [`Faucet`](using-beamx-faucet-contract-with-cli-wallet.md#faucet-contract)
* [`BeamX DAO`](using-beamx-faucet-contract-with-cli-wallet.md#beamx-dao-contract)

## `Faucet` contract

The Beam `Faucet` contract allows users to withdraw or deposit small amounts of Beam coins.&#x20;

### All `Faucet` contract commands

To view all the available contract commands, enter this command:

```
./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders/faucet/app.wasm -n 127.0.0.1:8501
```

```
./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders/faucet/app.wasm -n 127.0.0.1:8501

### View contract

Be sure you have the latest version of [`Faucet`](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/tree/mainnet/bvm/Shaders/faucet) inside your `shaders` folder as instructed. The `app.wasm` file uses `Faucet` and `contract.wasm` interacts with the blockchain.

We will use the Beam Faucet contract to retrieve the contract`CID`from the blockchain for this example.

The Command Line instructions for`Faucet`are compatible with macOS (Terminal Window), Linux (Shell), and Windows (Command Prompt) but for the example below, we will use Terminal Window commands.

#### Retrieving the Faucet contract

{% hint style="info" %}
We assume that your node is running on a local machine at `port 8501`. If your parameters differ from any of the instructions, please adjust them accordingly.
{% endhint %}

1.  Launch a Terminal Window and change the directory to your Beam CLI wallet by entering the following command:

    ```
    cd /wallet_folder
    ```
2.  Assuming you followed the proper subfolder hierarchy for Faucet, enter the following command:

    ```
    ./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders/faucet/app.wasm -n 127.0.0.1:8501 --shader_args="role=manager,action=view"
    ```



    ```
    ./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders/faucet/app.wasm -n 127.0.0.1:8501 --shader_args="role=manager,action=view"

    I 2021-10-19.16:16:18.853 Beam Wallet 6.1.12023 (mainnet)
    I 2021-10-19.16:16:18.854 Rules signature: 0-ed91a717313c6eb0, 321321-6d622e615cfd29d0, 777777-1ce8f721bf0c9fa7, 1280000-3eaab6ab65b65f94
    I 2021-10-19.16:16:18.854 starting a wallet...
    I 2021-10-19.16:16:19.093 wallet successfully opened...

    "Height": 1280003}]}
    ```

This command will result in a list of Contract `IDs` from shaders of faucet types currently deployed on the network. It is possible for more than one shader because the Application Shader (`app.wasm`) can interact with several different Contract Shaders (`contract.wasm`) of the same type.

### Withdraw Beams from contract

To withdraw 0.05 Beams from the`Faucet`contract, enter the following command:

```
./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders\faucet\app.wasm --shader_args="role=my_account,action=withdraw,cid=3fdd4171972875e0ac8f0131b3da047e8323cc9c2c8d53327be427c455d2a716,amount=6100000" -n 127.0.0.1:8501
```

You can replace the`CID`parameter with a different contract `ID` that you received in the previous [steps](using-beamx-faucet-contract-with-cli-wallet.md#view-contract).

{% hint style="info" %}
**A transaction fee of 0.011 Beams automatically subtracts from the`Faucet`contract withdrawal**. In total, the action draws 0.061 Beams + the transaction fee, leaving the user with 0.05 Beams.
{% endhint %}

This operation can result in several different outcomes:

* Each contract`Faucet`limits the amount of Beam coins you can withdraw within a given timeframe. These 'constructor parameters' of the shader specify that you should receive the Beams you have requested when you are under that limit.
* If you exceed this limit, you will receive nothing or a`Magical Error 17`, depending on the contract implementation.
* `Magical Error 17`can also appear for a different glitch within the contract.

But how do I know what are the contract parameters?

### Contract parameters

To view all available contract parameters, enter the following:

```
./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders\faucet\app.wasm --shader_args="role=manager,action=view_params,cid=3fdd4171972875e0ac8f0131b3da047e8323cc9c2c8d53327be427c455d2a716" -n 127.0.0.1:8501
```

```
./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders\faucet\app.wasm --shader_args="role=manager,action=view_params,cid=3fdd4171972875e0ac8f0131b3da047e8323cc9c2c8d53327be427c455d2a716" -n 127.0.0.1:8501
I 2021-10-19.17:06:35.384 Beam Wallet 6.1.12023 (mainnet)

Executing shader...
Shader output: {"params": {"backlogPeriod": 1440,"withdrawLimit": 6100000}}
```

The shader output should resemble the following:

```
"": {"params": {"backlogPeriod": 1440,"withdrawLimit": 6100000}}
```

The above output means you can extract up to 0.061 Beam every 1440 blocks from this `Facuet`.

### Deposit Beams to`Faucet`

To deposit the 0.05 Beam to the `Faucet` , enter the following:

```
./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders\faucet\app.wasm --shader_args="role=my_account,action=deposit,cid=3fdd4171972875e0ac8f0131b3da047e8323cc9c2c8d53327be427c455d2a716,amount=5000000" -n 127.0.0.1:8501
```

You can replace the`CID`parameter with any contract `ID` received from the [view contract](using-beamx-faucet-contract-with-cli-wallet.md#view-contract) step.

### Create your Faucet

Since the Faucet is not an 'ownable' contract, creating a different faucet contract with the same parameters is impossible. The solution is to create your own parameters.

Be sure you have to `contract.wasm` file (located in `app.wasm` folder) file to properly deploy the new contract to the blockchain.

With that out of the way, enter the following command:

```
./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders/faucet/app.wasm -n 127.0.0.1:8501 --shader_args="role=manager,action=create,backlogPeriod=13,withdrawLimit=520000000" --shader_contract_file shaders/faucet/contract.wasm
```

Assuming a `Faucet` contract has not run within the last 13 blocks, the contract deployment will be successful, and a new contract will issue the return value.

The final step is to deposit funds into the`Faucet`contract and share the contract `ID` with another user!

## BeamX DAO contract

The founding mission behind Beam was to make the Beam ecosystem as decentralized as possible. The introduction of the BeamX DAO is another step towards realizing that founding mission. The BeamX DAO empowers BeamX stakeholders with total control over the governance protocol.

Stakeholders have voting power on every aspect of the ecosystem through the BeamX token.

BeamX stakeholders are encouraged to vote with the personal voting selection, identity, and financial holdings will all remain private.

BeamX has a 100M total supply with a 4-year emission schedule. Earn BeamX tokens by staking your Beam coins.

### View contract

#### Retrieve the`DAO`contract

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure the latest version of the`dao-core`contract folder is within the`shaders_folder` hierarchy as previously instructed. Both `app.wasm`(`Faucet`) and`contract.wasm`to deploy your `DAO`contract.
{% endhint %}

1.  Launch a Terminal Window and change the directory to your Beam CLI wallet by entering the following command:

    ```
    cd /wallet_folder
    ```
2.  Enter the following command:

    ```
    ./beam-wallet shader --shader_app_file shaders/dao-core/app.wasm -n 127.0.0.1:8501 --shader_args="role=manager,action=view"
    ```

    The result will display the contract registered to the Beam blockchain.&#x20;

    The`CID`contract output should resemble the following:

    ```

### Staking Beam

{% hint style="info" %}
**The minimum amount of Beam coins users must stake in order to receive BeamX rewards is 16 Beams!**
{% endhint %}

To receive BeamX tokens, users must first stake their Beam coins by issuing a contract and claiming their BeamX tokens as rewards. To stake their Beam coins, enter the following command:

```
./beam-wallet  shader --shader_app_file Shaders/dao-core-masternet/app.wasm --shader_args role=manager,action=farm_update,cid=3f3d32e38cb27ac7b5b67343f81cf2f8bc53217eb995cc6c5d78ddc5e7b0642b,amountBeam=1600000000,bLockOrUnlock=1 -n 127.0.0.1:8501
```

For this example, we will use the minimum 16 Beam coins required to fulfill the staking requirements of this contract.&#x20;

```
./beam-wallet  shader --shader_app_file Shaders/dao-core-masternet/app.wasm --shader_args role=manager,action=farm_update,cid=3f3d32e38cb27ac7b5b67343f81cf2f8bc53217eb995cc6c5d78ddc5e7b0642b,amountBeam=1600000000,bLockOrUnlock=1 -n 127.0.0.1:8501
