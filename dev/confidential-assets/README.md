Beam Confidential Assets (CA) are an important extension that allows users to register new asset types and emit (or burn) these assets by simply running commands in the CLI wallet, without any need for programming or smart contracts.&#x20;

In the screenshot below you see an example of Beam Desktop Wallet holding RAYS - which are Beam Community engagement tokes implemented as CA on Beam chain:
